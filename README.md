# dashboard-exercise

* Andrew Chaa
* Dashboard in react.js, api gateway and apis are in ASP.NET Web Api2
* Libraries used: 
  * Api: ASP.NET Web Api 2, Ninject, Dapper, NLog, and Moq
  * Client-side: react.js, react-router, and react-chartlist
* The architecture: Microservices over HTTP for this exercise. Ideally messaging rather than api call would be more scalable, supporting CQRS.
